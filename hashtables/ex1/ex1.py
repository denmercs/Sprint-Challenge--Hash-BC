    Given a package with a weight limit `limit` and a list `weights` of item weights, implement a function `get_indices_of_item_weights` that finds two items whose sum of weights equals the weight limit `limit`. Your function will return an instance of an `Answer` tuple that has the following form:

    (zero, one)

    where each element represents the item weights of the two packages. _**The higher valued index should be placed in the `zeroth` index and the smaller index should be placed in the `first` index.**_ If such a pair doesnâ€™t exist for the given inputs, your function should return `None`.
